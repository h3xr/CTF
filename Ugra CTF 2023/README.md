Ugra CTF Quals 2023 is an open information security competition for beginners. It is a 36-hour online event. Everybody is welcome to participate.

This CTF is organized by [[team Team]](https://ctftime.org/team/49808) in a joint effort with Ugra Research Institute of 
Information Technologies and Information Technologies and Digital Development Department of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug — Ugra.

Teams of high school students and others are playing in separate scoreboards, but they will be merged upon uploading to CTFtime.

Note: This year challenges will be a bit easier than usual. If you enjoyed our previous years' Quals, come and join us at Ugra CTF Open 2023 which will be held June 2023.

The official language of Ugra CTF is Russian, but you are welcome to participate even if you don’t speak it. We will try our best to ensure that no task relies on something that can’t be understood by proper use of machine translation.

NOTE: Сбт, 14 Янв. 2023, 07:00 UTC — Вск, 15 Янв. 2023, 19:00 UTC
